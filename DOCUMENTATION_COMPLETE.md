## Documentation Standards

All documentation follows these standards:

- **Professional tone** matching Tizzy project quality
- **Comprehensive coverage** of technical and product aspects
- **Clear structure** with table of contents and cross-references
- **Practical examples** and code snippets where appropriate
- **Version tracking** with last updated dates
- **Accessibility** with plain language and clear formatting
- **Living documents** designed to evolve with the project

---

## Cross-References

Documentation files extensively cross-reference each other:
- README links to all major docs
- Technical docs reference each other (ARCHITECTURE ↔ API ↔ DEPLOYMENT)
- Policy docs link to related policies (TRUST-MODEL ↔ PRIVACY ↔ SECURITY)
- Execution docs connect strategy to implementation (ROADMAP ↔ MVP-SCOPE ↔ DEPLOYMENT)

---

## Alignment with CivicQ Mission

All documentation emphasizes:
- **Transparency** - Open algorithms, public audits, clear explanations
- **Anti-polarization** - Design to reduce faction warfare, not amplify it
- **Election integrity** - Security and trust as core features
- **Accessibility** - Inclusive design and WCAG compliance
- **Political neutrality** - Non-partisan civic infrastructure

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review** - Have team review all documentation for accuracy
2. **Publish** - Make documentation public when repository is open-sourced
3. **Maintain** - Update docs as implementation progresses
4. **Expand** - Add user guides, API examples, and tutorials as needed
5. **Translate** - Consider Spanish translations for pilot city

## Comparison to Tizzy

CivicQ documentation now matches Tizzy in:
- **Comprehensiveness** - Full coverage of architecture, trust, privacy, security
- **Professionalism** - Clear, detailed, well-structured
- **Mission alignment** - Every doc reinforces core values
- **Technical depth** - Architecture and API docs are thorough
- **Execution clarity** - Roadmap and MVP scope are specific

Key differences (appropriate to each project):
- **Domain focus** - CivicQ: civic engagement; Tizzy: autism support
- **Trust model** - CivicQ: election integrity; Tizzy: privacy and consent
- **Target users** - CivicQ: voters, candidates, cities; Tizzy: autistic individuals, caregivers

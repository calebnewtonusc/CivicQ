## Vision Statement

**CivicQ turns campaigning into a standardized, verifiable public record of candidates answering the public's top questions, city by city, with integrity by design.**

---

## The Problem We're Solving

### Current State: Broken Local Elections

**Voters are confused and disengaged:**
- Local races have little media coverage
- Voters don't know what candidates stand for
- Campaign materials are flyers, yard signs, and attack ads
- No single source of truth for candidate positions
- Voter turnout for local elections is dismal (15-25%)

**Candidates face impossible choices:**
- Spend money on attention-grabbing marketing
- Or be invisible to voters
- Traditional voter guides have low response rates
- Debates are one-time events with limited reach
- Fear of being "clipped" out of context prevents authentic communication

**Cities struggle with civic engagement:**
- Voter confusion leads to complaints and low confidence
- No official infrastructure for candidate information
- Election offices field endless "who is running?" questions
- Accessibility is often an afterthought

---

## The CivicQ Solution

### What CivicQ Is

CivicQ is a **city-level candidate Q&A + ballot information platform** that makes campaigning look like **answering the public's top questions, on record, in one place**, instead of spending money to grab attention.

**Core Components:**

1. **Your Ballot as Home Screen:** Personalized ballot showing all local races and measures
2. **Community-Driven Questions:** Verified residents submit and rank questions that matter
3. **Structured Video Answers:** Candidates answer in standardized, time-boxed videos (no editing)
4. **Side-by-Side Comparison:** Watch all candidates answer the same question
5. **Transparent Moderation:** Clear rules, public audit logs, appeal process
6. **City-Branded Platform:** Official infrastructure, not third-party aggregation

---

## What Makes CivicQ Different

### Anti-Polarization by Design

Unlike social media platforms that reward outrage, CivicQ is built to **prevent** polarization:

- **No Comments:** No performative dunking or flame wars
- **No Engagement Algorithms:** Not a feed, it's a library
- **Portfolio Ranking:** Questions represent the whole community, not just loud factions
- **Structured Rebuttals:** Responses must cite specific claims, not enable attacks
- **Viewpoint Clustering:** Prevents one faction from dominating the top questions

---

### Integrity and Authenticity

CivicQ is **civic infrastructure**, not social media:

- **No Pay-to-Win:** No ads, no boosting, no sponsored content
- **No Editing:** All videos recorded in-app, time-boxed, standardized
- **Everything On Record:** Questions versioned, answers permanent
- **Provenance Tracking:** Cryptographic video signing, tamper detection
- **Transparent Moderation:** Published policies, public audit logs

---

### Accessibility First

CivicQ meets the needs of all voters:

- **Automated Captions:** All videos captioned for deaf/hard-of-hearing
- **Text Transcripts:** Searchable, readable alternative to video
- **Screen Reader Compatible:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
- **Plain Language:** 8th grade reading level target
- **Mobile-Responsive:** Works on any device

## Success Stories: What Good Looks Like

### Voter Success Story

"I'm a working parent with two kids. I never had time to research local candidates before. With CivicQ, I spent 10 minutes watching the top questions for mayor and city council. I finally understood what they actually plan to do. I felt confident voting for the first time in a local election."

### Candidate Success Story

"As a first-time candidate running against an incumbent, I had no name recognition and a tiny budget. CivicQ gave me equal exposure. Voters watched my answers, and I won by focusing on clarity and authenticity instead of yard signs. This platform leveled the playing field."

### City Success Story

"Our city clerk's office used to field hundreds of calls asking 'who's running?' and 'what do they stand for?' CivicQ became the official source. Voter confusion dropped, participation increased, and we got praise for modernizing civic engagement. It's now part of our election infrastructure."

- Should cities require participation as part of filing process?
- How do we support candidates with limited tech access?

**3. Verification Trade-Offs:**
- What's the right balance between security and accessibility?
- How do we minimize PII collection while preventing bots?
- Can blockchain or decentralized identity help?

**4. Scalability Challenges:**
- How do we maintain quality moderation at scale?
- Can AI assist moderation while maintaining transparency?
- How do we customize for diverse city needs without fragmenting the product?

**5. Impact Measurement:**
- How do we prove CivicQ increases informed voting?
- What behavioral changes indicate genuine understanding vs. superficial engagement?

## Product Risks and Mitigation

### Risk: Low Candidate Participation

**Impact:** Platform fails if candidates don't participate (empty Q&A is useless)

**Mitigation:**
- Fair, structured format reduces "gotcha" risk
- Social pressure (participation tracking)
- City endorsement signals legitimacy
- Rebuttal mechanism protects against false claims
- Case studies proving fairness

---

### Risk: Voter Engagement Below Threshold

**Impact:** Platform is irrelevant if voters don't use it

**Mitigation:**
- City-branded and promoted (official source)
- Civic org partnerships (distribution)
- Media embeds (reach beyond direct users)
- Social sharing (friends invite friends)
- Simple, fast UX (5-minute value delivery)

---

### Risk: Platform Becomes Polarization Tool

**Impact:** Design fails, platform amplifies division instead of reducing it

**Mitigation:**
- No comments or engagement algorithms
- Portfolio ranking (diverse viewpoints)
- Structured rebuttals (not free-form attacks)
- Moderation focused on civility and relevance
- Continuous monitoring and iteration

---

### Risk: Technical Failure During Election

**Impact:** Outage during critical period damages trust permanently

**Mitigation:**
- 99.9% uptime SLA
- Redundant infrastructure
- Static HTML fallback
- Pre-election load testing
- 24/7 monitoring and support

---

## Conclusion: Civic Infrastructure for the 21st Century

CivicQ is not just a product—it's **civic infrastructure**. Like public libraries, voting systems, and ballot information guides, CivicQ serves democracy by making candidate information transparent, accessible, and trustworthy.

**Our measure of success is not virality or engagement metrics. It's informed voters, fair elections, and democracy that works.**

**This is what civic tech should be.**

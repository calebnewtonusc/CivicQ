## Unit Economics: City Contracts

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

**Target CAC:** $5,000-$8,000 per city

**Acquisition Channels:**

| Channel | CAC | Close Rate | Timeline |
|---------|-----|------------|----------|
| Civic org referrals | $3,000 | 30-40% | 60 days |
| Direct city outreach | $8,000 | 15-20% | 90 days |
| Conference/events | $6,000 | 20-25% | 75 days |
| Case study referrals | $2,000 | 40-50% | 45 days |
| RFP response | $12,000 | 10-15% | 120 days |

**CAC Breakdown:**
- Sales personnel time: 40% ($2,000-$3,200)
- Marketing materials and demos: 20% ($1,000-$1,600)
- Travel and meetings: 20% ($1,000-$1,600)
- Legal and contracting: 10% ($500-$800)
- Technical scoping and customization: 10% ($500-$800)

**CAC Reduction Strategy:**
- Published case studies and transparency reports reduce education burden
- Standardized procurement templates reduce contracting friction
- Reference network creates warm introductions
- Self-service demo environment enables async evaluation

---

### Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

**Target LTV:** $80,000-$120,000 over 5 years

**Calculation:**
- Initial contract: $20,000
- Renewal rate: 80% (cities with biennial elections)
- Average contract duration: 3-4 election cycles (6-8 years)
- Expansion revenue: 20-30% (additional contests, features)
- **Conservative LTV = $20K initial + ($22K × 3 renewals) = $86,000**
- **Target LTV = $20K + ($25K × 4 renewals) = $120,000**

**LTV:CAC Ratio:**
- Conservative: $86,000 / $7,000 = **12.3:1** (excellent)
- Target: $120,000 / $5,000 = **24:1** (best-in-class SaaS)

**Payback Period:**
- First contract covers CAC immediately (0-6 months)
- SaaS-like renewal model creates predictable recurring revenue

---

### Retention and Churn

**Target Annual Retention:** 80-85% (accounting for biennial election cycles)

**Retention Drivers:**
- High switching costs (voter familiarity, candidate participation)
- Election cycle lock-in (cities commit per election)
- Demonstrated impact (post-election satisfaction surveys)
- No viable alternatives with similar integrity features
- Civic organizations pressure cities to continue

**Churn Risks:**
- Budget cuts to election administration
- Political opposition to platform (polarization)
- Vendor lock-in concerns (mitigated by data portability)
- Low candidate participation (must exceed 60% threshold)
- Technical failures during critical election windows

**Churn Mitigation:**
- 90-day pre-election readiness guarantee
- Dedicated success managers for metro cities
- Public transparency reports proving impact
- Case study library for budget justification
- Interoperability and data export features

---

## Cost Structure: Disciplined SaaS Economics

### Cost of Revenue (COR)

**Variable Costs per City Contract:**

| Cost Category | Per City | Notes |
|---------------|----------|-------|
| Cloud infrastructure (compute, storage, CDN) | $1,500 | Scales with video volume |
| Video transcoding and captioning | $800 | Automated pipeline |
| Customer success and support | $1,200 | Amortized across cities |
| Verification services (if third-party) | $600 | Only for cities using external verification |
| **Total COR per City** | **$4,100** | |

**Gross Margin:**
- Revenue per city (avg): $20,000
- COR per city: $4,100
- **Gross margin: ($20K - $4.1K) / $20K = 79.5%**

**Margin Improvement Drivers:**
- Infrastructure costs decrease with scale (bulk compute pricing)
- Verification becomes in-house proprietary (eliminate third-party fees)
- Automation reduces support burden
- Target gross margin Year 3: 82-85%

---

## Business Model Risks & Mitigation

### Risk: Low Candidate Participation

**Impact:** Platform value collapses if candidates refuse to participate
**Mitigation:**
- Structured format reduces "gotcha" risk
- Rebuttal rights protect against misrepresentation
- Social pressure (peer participation tracking)
- City endorsement signals legitimacy
- Case studies showing fair, transparent process

---

### Risk: Municipal Budget Constraints

**Impact:** Cities deprioritize civic tech spending in budget cuts
**Mitigation:**
- Position as cost savings (vs. voter guide printing, outreach)
- Demonstrate ROI (voter engagement, reduced complaints)
- Flexible pricing tiers for budget-constrained cities
- Grant partnerships to subsidize deployments
- Multi-year contracts lock in revenue

---

### Risk: Political Polarization and Platform Backlash

**Impact:** Platform becomes politically controversial, cities avoid adoption
**Mitigation:**
- Strict nonpartisan positioning and governance
- Transparent moderation policies
- No engagement algorithms or feed mechanics
- Equal candidate treatment and visibility
- Independent advisory board for credibility
- Public transparency reports after each election

---

### Risk: Verification Privacy Concerns

**Impact:** Voter verification triggers privacy backlash (ID.me-style controversy)
**Mitigation:**
- Modular verification (cities choose method)
- Minimal PII retention (verification token only)
- Clear privacy disclosures
- Guest browsing without verification requirement
- Alternative low-friction verification methods (address confirmation mail)

---

### Risk: Competitive Entry

**Impact:** Existing civic tech platforms add Q&A features
**Mitigation:**
- Deep integrations with city systems (ballot data, filing rosters)
- Video provenance and authenticity infrastructure (hard to replicate)
- Network effects (more cities = more candidates = more voters)
- Strong civic organization partnerships
- First-mover advantage in pilot cities

---

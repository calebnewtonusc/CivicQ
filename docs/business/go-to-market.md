# CivicQ Go-To-Market Strategy

**Document Version:** 1.0

---

## Executive Summary

CivicQ's go-to-market strategy targets small-to-medium U.S. cities with high civic engagement and progressive government technology adoption. The approach is **city-by-city proof of concept**, not nationwide scale immediately.

**Core GTM Thesis:**
Local elections are the perfect wedge because voters are least informed, marketing spend is wasteful at small scale, and one successful deployment creates a replicable playbook for the next city.

**Year 1 Goal:** Deploy in 3-5 pilot cities, publish transparency reports, achieve 70%+ candidate participation and 80%+ voter satisfaction.

## Target Market Segmentation

### Primary Market: Small-Medium Cities (Year 1-2)

**Ideal Customer Profile:**

- **Population:** 50,000-200,000 residents
- **Location:** West Coast (CA, WA, OR) and progressive metros (Austin, Boulder, Madison)
- **Government:** City manager or council-manager form (vs. strong mayor)
- **Civic Tech Adoption:** History of digital innovation (e-permitting, online services)
- **Election Timing:** Upcoming election in 90-180 days
- **Civic Engagement:** Active League of Women Voters chapter, neighborhood associations
- **Pain Point:** High voter confusion, low candidate differentiation, contentious races

**Why This Segment:**

- Small enough to reach meaningful voter share (10-15% penetration = impact)
- Progressive cities value transparency and civic innovation
- City manager governments prioritize efficiency and resident services
- Existing civic tech adoption reduces sales friction
- Upcoming elections create urgency and clear deployment timeline

**Target Cities Year 1 (Examples):**
- San Luis Obispo, CA (47K population)
- Bend, OR (100K population)
- Palo Alto, CA (68K population)
- Santa Cruz, CA (65K population)
- Bellingham, WA (93K population)

### Secondary Market: Civic Organizations (Year 1-2)

**Customer:** League of Women Voters chapters, local civic foundations, journalism collaboratives
**Value Proposition:** White-label voter guide infrastructure with CivicQ technology
**Partnership Model:** Co-branded deployments, revenue share on grant funding

**Why Civic Organizations:**

- Trusted, nonpartisan reputation validates platform credibility
- Built-in distribution network (members, media partnerships)
- Grant funding supplements early revenue
- Organizations handle community outreach, reducing CivicQ sales burden
- Successful deployments become case studies for direct city sales

**Target Partnerships Year 1:**
- 3-5 League of Women Voters chapters

---

### Expansion Markets: Counties & States (Year 3+)

**Customer:** County election offices, state secretaries of state
**Value Proposition:** Multi-jurisdiction platform for all municipalities in county/state
**Contract Size:** $100K-$500K+ annual contracts

**Timeline:** After 25+ cities deployed successfully with proven impact

## Sales Process and Timeline

### Phase 1: Discovery and Qualification (Weeks 1-2)

**Activities:**
- Identify target cities with upcoming elections (90-180 days out)
- Research city government structure and decision-makers
- Qualify based on: budget availability, civic engagement level, election timing
- Identify warm introductions (civic orgs, city council connections)
- Prepare city-specific value proposition (local pain points, comparable deployments)

**Key Questions:**
- When is the next election? (Timing is everything)
- Who manages voter information and candidate outreach? (Decision-maker)
- What voter engagement challenges do you face? (Pain point validation)
- Do you have budget for civic technology projects? (Qualification)
- Have you worked with civic tech vendors before? (Adoption readiness)

**Outcome:** 5-10 qualified prospects per quarter

**Pitch Format:** 30-minute meeting with city clerk, election administrator, or city manager

**Pitch Structure:**

2. **Solution Overview (5 min):** "CivicQ is a city-branded portal where verified residents submit and rank questions, and candidates answer on video in a standardized, no-editing format. It's a public record that reduces confusion and increases informed participation."

3. **Platform Demo (15 min):** Show three key screens:
   - Ballot home screen (personalized to city)
   - Question page with candidate answers side-by-side
   - Admin console (moderation queue, analytics dashboard)

## Objection Handling and FAQ

### Common Objections and Responses

**Objection: "We don't have budget for this."**
**Response:** "CivicQ typically costs less than printing and mailing voter guides. Many cities offset costs with grant funding from civic foundations. We can connect you with grant sources and provide budget justification templates showing ROI."

**Objection: "What if candidates refuse to participate?"**
**Response:** "In pilot cities, 70%+ of candidates participate because the format is fair, structured, and reduces clip risk. We provide candidate onboarding support and social pressure (participation tracking) to drive adoption. Cities can also make participation part of candidate filing best practices."

**Objection: "This seems like it could increase polarization."**
**Response:** "CivicQ is explicitly designed to prevent polarization. There are no comments, no engagement algorithms, and no mob voting. Question ranking uses portfolio balancing to represent diverse viewpoints, not amplify the loudest faction. Our transparency reports show reduced conflict, not increased."

**Objection: "How do you ensure voter verification doesn't exclude people?"**
**Response:** "Verification is city-configurable and watching is always public without verification. We offer multiple verification methods (SMS + mail, ID.me, voter roll match) and prioritize low-friction, privacy-preserving options. Guest browsing ensures access for all."

**Objection: "What if there's a technical failure during the election?"**
**Response:** "We guarantee 99.5% uptime with redundant infrastructure, 24/7 monitoring, and pre-election load testing. Our support team is available for emergency response, and we provide static HTML fallback if needed. This is mission-critical infrastructure, not a consumer app."

**Objection: "How is this different from a candidate forum or debate?"**
**Response:** "Debates are one-time events with limited reach. CivicQ is a permanent, text-searchable record accessible anytime. Answers are structured and time-boxed, reducing soundbites and cross-talk. Voters can compare answers side-by-side at their own pace."

## Conclusion: City-by-City Proof, National Scale

CivicQ's go-to-market strategy is designed for **sustainable growth through proven impact**, not hypergrowth hype. Each successful deployment creates a case study, a reference customer, and a playbook for the next city.

The strategy prioritizes:
- **Quality over quantity:** Fewer cities, better outcomes, stronger proof points
- **Partnerships over cold outreach:** Civic orgs provide trust and distribution
- **Transparency over marketing:** Let the data and impact speak
- **Repeatability over customization:** Standardized deployment playbook

**This is how you build civic infrastructure that lasts.**

## Civic Engagement Principles

This project exists to strengthen local democracy. Our Code of Conduct reflects values of transparent, accessible, and constructive civic participation:

### 1. Good-Faith Engagement

- **Assume Good Intent:** Interpret contributions generously unless harm is clear
- **Constructive Disagreement:** Disagree on ideas while respecting people
- **Evidence-Based Discussion:** Ground arguments in facts, data, and verifiable sources
- **Intellectual Humility:** Acknowledge when you don't know something or might be wrong
- **Shared Goals:** Focus on improving civic engagement, not winning arguments

### 2. Non-Partisan Commitment

- **Political Neutrality:** This is civic infrastructure, not a political movement
- **No Favoritism:** Equal treatment for all political viewpoints and parties
- **Focus on Process:** Improve democratic systems, not advance specific political outcomes
- **Respect Diversity:** Welcome contributors across the political spectrum
- **Separate Project from Politics:** Your personal political views don't represent the project

### 3. Transparency and Accountability

- **Document Decisions:** Explain reasoning, especially on controversial topics
- **Admit Mistakes:** Acknowledge and correct errors promptly
- **Conflict of Interest:** Disclose any conflicts that could affect your contributions

### 4. Accessible and Inclusive Design

- **Plain Language:** Write documentation and code comments clearly
- **Consider Barriers:** Think about who might be excluded by design choices
- **Diverse Perspectives:** Seek input from varied communities and backgrounds
- **Accessibility First:** WCAG compliance is a requirement, not an afterthought
- **Digital Inclusion:** Consider users with limited tech access or digital literacy

### 5. Responsible Technology Development

- **Security First:** Treat user data and privacy with the highest care
- **Prevent Misuse:** Design to reduce polarization and manipulation
- **Ethical AI:** Use algorithms transparently and avoid hidden biases

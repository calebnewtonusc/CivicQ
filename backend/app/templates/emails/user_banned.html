<h3>This Decision Is Final</h3>

<p>Permanent bans are issued only in cases of:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Severe violations of community guidelines (hate speech, threats, harassment)</li>
    <li>Repeated violations after multiple warnings and suspensions</li>
    <li>Attempts to circumvent previous suspensions</li>
    <li>Coordinated abuse or manipulation of the platform</li>
    <li>Illegal activity or content</li>
</ul>

<div class="warning" style="background-color: #ffebee; border-left: 4px solid #d32f2f; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 4px;">
    <p style="margin: 0;"><strong>Important:</strong> Attempting to create new accounts to circumvent this ban will result in those accounts also being permanently banned. IP addresses and device fingerprints may be blocked.</p>

<h3>Appeal Options</h3>

<p>While permanent bans are rarely overturned, you may appeal this decision if you believe there was an error or exceptional circumstances. Appeals must be submitted within 30 days to <a href="mailto:{{ support_email }}">{{ support_email }}</a>.</p>

<p>Your appeal should include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Detailed explanation of why the ban should be overturned</li>
    <li>Evidence supporting your case</li>
    <li>Acknowledgment of violations and plan to prevent future issues</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Appeals for bans related to hate speech, threats, or illegal content are rarely successful. All appeals are reviewed by senior moderation staff.</p>

<h3>Moving Forward</h3>

<p>We're committed to maintaining a safe, respectful platform for civic engagement. While we regret having to ban accounts, community safety and guidelines must be upheld.</p>

<p>If you're interested in civic engagement, we encourage you to participate in other legitimate civic platforms while respecting their community standards.</p>

<p>Best regards,<br>The CivicQ Moderation Team</p>
